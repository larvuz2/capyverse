This directory should contain the animation files:
- idle.glb: Played when the character is stationary on the ground
- walk.glb: Played when the character is moving on the ground
- jump.glb: Played when the character is airborne (jumping)

Each animation file should contain a single animation clip that will be applied to the capybara character model.
